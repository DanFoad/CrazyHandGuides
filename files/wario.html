	<h1>Wario</h1>
	<h2>Author:<a href = "https://www.reddit.com/user/Lepaz14"> /u/Lepaz14</a></h2>
	<p>Why Wario? Here's a thorough list of reasons.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>He points at the ground for his dtilt</li>
		<li>He's by far one of the least played characters on For Glory, 
		meaning that a definitive anti-Wario strategy hasn't really been shoved into everyone's brains. 
		Compare that to Little Mac, who is perhaps the most played character yet has a 20% winrate.</li>
		<li>He rides a bike.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>I love Wario. Game & Watch was Melee's definitive "weird" character, and Wario is that guy for this game. 
	He walks sideways. He pokes at your feet. He eats tires.
	You can't get much weirder than Wario, and that's why he's so much fun to absolutely crush foes with. 
	He literally has to hinge his jaw back into place after laughing so hard at how terribly destroyed his opponent got.</p>
	<p>Compared to the rest of the cast, though, he plays a bit statically. 
	While this might be a con for some, I actually enjoy how formulaic he can be. 
	He's not predictable enough to have every move of his sidestepped, but it only takes a few games to get Sakurai-level with Wario. 
	Don't come into Wario 101 expecting to take years of practice like you would Rosalina or Shulk to be good with him. 
	He's definitely a beginner level character, and the no-platforms style of For Glory certainly favors the Harley-Davidson playstyle.</p>
	<p>I'm mentioning how Wario plays like clockwork a lot. I suppose I should explain what I mean by that.<br>
	STEP-BY-STEP GET-WINS-QUICK GUIDE:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Start the game. This is important.</li>
	<li>Right off the bat, you'll need to take a gander at the opponent. 
	If they are just sitting there, give them what they want! Ride your motorcycle into them at full speed.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Note: If you're going full speed, jumping off the bike 50% of the way there will still give the bike enough "push" to actually deal damage to the enemy.
		If you keep doing this, though, they WILL catch on and will start preparing a fair for you before you even jump off the thing. 
		It's still a decent strategy for when you see them charging up a projectile or smash attack, though.</li>
		<li>Also, your bike goes through counters (usually)! Don't put your brakes on if you see Lucina in the midst of a counter.
		At full speed, your bike will trigger the counter but you'll be behind her by the time she attacks with her down-b.</li>
		<li>In the event that you've fallen of your bike, EAT IT. You NEED your bike to recover, as the range on your Up-A isn't that great and you DON'T want to waste your waft (which isn't lost through dying, rather just by using it). 
		If it's on the stage and you're not on the bike, you won't be able to use it again until it's thrown off, eaten, or put back to use by pressing side-b while on top of it.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Reverse for another quick hit if they weren't launched into the air too high. 
	This usually applies to mid to heavy tier characters, though, like R.O.B. or Captain Falcon.</li>
	<li>In the event they are going aggro and started charging at you during the first few seconds of the match, time your chomp so that their token dash attack will land them in your esophagus. 
	Afterwards, continue your sales pitch.</li>
	<li>The battle will drone on. You can continue to spam your bike or shake it up a little bit by jumping off as mentioned in Step 2.1.
	If that's not your thing, remember that your grab range is decent, your aerials are superb, and that your uair, the clap, is AMAZING. 
	Against projectile spammers, remember that your chomp absorbs most projectiles. 
	I made a Mega Man SD out of pure frustration after he got me to 120% yet couldn't kill me after I figured this one out.</li>
	<li>Once they figure out how to shield and stay on the ground for longer than three seconds, abuse your almost lag-less ftilt (the punch) and your quick jab combo.</li>
	<li>This is important. Throughout the match, your waft (Down-B) is charging. 
	Do NOT use it until you've taken their first stock and they're on their last (two stock games, basically).
	Even then, don't use it until you've actually started glowing, which will happen 1 min 50 sec after the game starts, or sooner if you've been eating motorcycles or projectiles.</li>
	<li>Continue being a hog and spam your bike to rack up some damage. Get them to around 40%.</li>
	<li>When they are spamming roll while next to you, use it. Don't ever force your waft. 
	I've never seen a Wario successfully waltz over to someone and manage to get an instant waft off, unless the opponent was very unaware of how strong Wario and his cheesiness are. 
	It has a surprisingly bad horizontal hitbox, which is why you should treat it as a very potent down-smash.</li>
	<li>Taunt.</li>
	<li>Wario's bike is VERY spammable. Riding it off the stage (your goal) takes less than a second for it to respawn, allowing you to ride it off, double jump, micro-pause, and then ride it back on as they fall asleep or something.</li>
	<li>Never forget how useful his Chomp is. Not only can it absorb and heal you off of projectiles, using it before you land allows for the mystical air-chomp.
	Throw them offstage with your chomp and then sit there waiting for their recovery by preparing another chomp. Rinse and repeat!</li>
	<li>Wario's side-taunt is very fast and can be spammed for maximum disrespect.</li>
	<p>The only cons:</p>
	<li>Wario blows through his maximum amount of three taunts in For Glory quite easily.</li>
	<p>I hope you enjoyed the quick Harley-Davidson Wario guide! Hopefully, tears will be shed on For Glory tonight from the roadkill you will create after reading this guide. 
	If there's one type of spammable cheese in this game, it's the Wario Bike. Don't spam it.</p>
