	<h1>About</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>Hello everyone, I am so glad you stopped by this website.</p>
	<p>First, I would like to say thanks to all the amazing users at /r/CrazyHand for making all these amazing character guides. It's a lot of work moving all the text to the website, but it's something that I enjoy doing. Please be aware that these guides were taken from the wiki page of /r/crazyhand.</p>
	<p>There is still a lot of work to be done, I need to add images for the DLC characters, and I also need more guides. I will also buy a domain for this website once it is 99% complete! If you feel like contributing, be sure to contact me on <a href="https://github.com/HappyZombies">GitHub</a> and/or <a href="https://reddit.com/u/HappyZombies">Reddit</a></p>.
	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<h4>1. There are plenty of guides in Smashboards, why should I go here instead?</h4>
	<p><i>- Smashboards is an amazing community. But I intended /r/crazyhand to be place for beginners and pros alike to come together and discuss about the competitive scene of Smash Bros. Smashboards can be a bit intimidating for beginning players wanting to get to the competitive side of Smash Bros. Here, we try our best to keep it straight forward and simple.</i></p>
	<h4>2. Some guides on the wiki are not here...</h4>
	<p><i>- Yes, there are two reasons why a guide isn't on the site. One is because the guide has not yet been made yet and second because the guide was a 'comment guide' and not a thread guide. Thread guides provide more information than comment guides, so it is preferred that I show those instead.</i></p>
	<h4>3. There are ton of other guides on different websites, why not just take those?</h4>
	<p><i>Although true, we want these guides to be made by fellow users of the subreddit /r/crazyhand.</i></p>
	<h4>4. I want to help!</h4>
	<p><i>-Awesome! If you know HTML/CSS/Javascript be sure to head over to GitHub were the files are being held and hosted. If you want certain links to be displayed then tell me ! If you want to make a guide, head over to the subreddit! We will gladly accept your work</i></p>
