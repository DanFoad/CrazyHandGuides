		Mr. Game and Watch is a solid character. For those of you who play or are curious about the 2D wonder, you might wanna check out this great guide. I'll be covering every nook and cranny GW has to offer! With that said, let us begin!
Down Throw: GW has one of the best Down Throw Combos in the game. At low percents he can do a Judge, Up-Tilt, Bucket, ShortHop Up-Air which can lead into a Up-B and finally, Short Hop Nair. All of those are guaranteed. At higher percents you wanna do a Full or ShortHop Judge, Bucket, Nair and Up-Air. At very high percents you'll wanna do a Up-B; be sure to aim for the opponent. These Combos work very well and is GW's best move by far. It works best on Fast-Fallers and Heavy-Weights. At 0% with characters like Captain Falcon he can do a Down-Throw, Up-Tilt, Down-Throw, Up-Tilt, Down-Throw and finish it off with a Nair. This combo is almost always guaranteed and True. So always go for a Down-Throw whenever you can, just don't spam it, you WILL get punished.
Combos: GW has a very Free-Style playstyle. The only Combos I can remember are, Up-B into Fair or Dair. But he has some very free-style guaranteed combos with a certain move which I'll get into later..........
Play-Style/Approaching: BE SAFE! He's the second lightest character in the game! Approach with aerials! Come at them with Fairs, Bairs and Bacon! NEVER, BE RISKY. You have to play smart. Rarely ever go for something unless you're sure it'll work. And stop Rolling all over the place and going for Dairs on land! Speaking of Dairs......
Air Game: GW has a great Air Game. Fair, Bair and Dair are great for edge-guarding. Uair has a Wind-Box! He sends enemies flying into the air! Use it to Gimp characters! Use it when They're recovering so they'll die or land high on ground and be forced to deal with the end lag (I'm looking at you Ness and Lucario)! Use it to stall enemies in the air so you can confuse them and carry out combos! Wait, forgot to mention somethings. Immediately after hit-stun, GW's Dair doesn't make you fall down. It still does the attack animation, but you don't fall down. It's great for catching enemies off-guard and stealing a kill. Believe me, it saved my but multiple times! Also, the Dair CAN Spike. It's hella hard to do. You have to do it at the exact moment the move starts. Like the first Frame. That's all!
Ground-Game: His ground game is good, not great. His Dash-Attack is very good, but very punishable. His Side Tilt is quite strong, it has the potential to kill! Down-Tilt is kinda useless, but it can reflect projectiles with it's great Wind-Box! [1] Up-Tilt is only useful when you combine it with Down-Throw. That's kinda it. But he has very good Smash-Attacks. Speaking of which.....
Smash-Attacks: Mr. Game and Watch's Smash-Attacks are godly like the time I went to Taco Bell and ordered a sock. His Forward-Smash is quite good. The Fire part is the Sweet-Spot while the stick is the sour-spot. The Fire part is very good for damage and has immense killing power! It killed Mario at the center of FD at 108% (no DI, Rage or anything. Just pure.)! Not so much about the Torch. Same thing goes for his Down-Smash. It has a very good Sweet-Spot at the edge of the hammers. An uncharged Down-Smash kills Mario at 103% (No DI, Rage or anything. Just pure.). The Sour-Spot isn't very good. Use the move when you're confused to where your opponent is going or use it to Punish Roll-Happy spammers! His Up-Smash is the best one. It has the same exact killing power as the Torch but slightly less damage (2%). But the Torch's power depends on how close you are to the Blast-Line. And it has a REALLY small Hit-Box. But why is it the greatest? Let me put it simply....
Techniques: His Up-Smash has Invincibility on the Upper-Half of his body. [2] It makes it great for catching falling opponents and reading an attack. Nuff said. Pivot Attacks really help GW. When running, do a Tilt or Smash attack behind you. Since his Chair/Forward-Smash has good damage and KO Power, it really helps. You can Pivot-Grab, but instead of pressing the button, you have to hold it. Also, if Dash-Attack then immediately grab, your grab range will be extended. It really helps his poor grab range. Use lasting Hit-Boxes to confuse and harass your enemies. Also, if you jump then immediately Up-Smash, your Up-Smash will have a small sliding effect. Like a mini DACUS.
Biggest Flaw: He can't kill if his life depended on it. He has some kill moves but they're hard to use properly. He can rack up the damage easily, but can't seal the deal. Which gives him a HORRIBLE matchup against Lucario.
How to Cover up Said Flaw: Your opponents will usually live up to 150% before you kill them. You have to use every tool you have to kill. Gimping is his best choice. Gimp with Fair's and Bair's lasting Hit-Boxes, Dair to attack enemies recovering from below. Use Down-Tilt and Uair's Wind-Box to confuse. Chef is one of his best Gimping options. This is all he has. Use it wisely.
Specials: His Up-B is a great combo beginner, finisher and works as a fantastic recovery! It can Stage-Spike enemies who try to spike you! Judge is a glass canon. If it works, it's bootiful (canon). If it doesn't work, you're screwed (glass). Bucket is a very powerful tool. It can stop your jump in the air, and if you use it again in the air and combine it with your second jump, you get a floaty high extended Double-Jump. Oh yeah, it's energy absorbing powers can easily OHKO enemies. Use it with your Down-Throw and use it as an edge-guard. His Chef is very good. It Gimps great, and has a second use. I present to you....BACON BAITING! It's like Falco's lasers, but better! You throw Bacon into the air, it hits an enemy, and you can have an automatic attack! But if they Shield, bring out the Down-Throw! When it hits an enemy, you get a free attack with any of your moves. Making this move very useful!
Strengths: Very good combo ability, glass canon, hard to Gimp, unpredictable, gets high damage very fast and good at Gimping!
Weaknesses: Very light, always has to be careful, very poor killing ability and a glass canon.
Overall: After tons of practice and following this guide, your Mr. Game and Watch should look like this. [3] GW is a very good character and it's sad how overlooked he is. Just because he was nerfed doesn't mean he's garbage. He has some very good strengths, and some crippling weaknesses. But in my eyes, the strengths overshadow the weaknesses. Just try your best to work around it. Also, he's the most fun and satisfying character to play as! So those of you who still think he's bad and don't want to main him, can you please give him a chance? I hope this guide helped you!
