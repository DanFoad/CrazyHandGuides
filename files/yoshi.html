	<h1>Yoshi</h1>

	<p>Yoshi is a fun character to use, and has loads of competitive potential. While with all the changes to him from Brawl make him seem like a rush-down character, he now has a very unique playstyle that can only be described as "defensively agressive" with elements of both a utility character and a rush-down character. By this I mean that a good Yoshi will be opportunistic with attacks and punishes, yet careful and safe with approaches and combos.</p>
	<p>This makes for a well-rounded character that turns out to be a lot like Mario, bar the air speed. Yoshi plays quite differently than Mario, however.</p>
	<h2>Notable Moves:</h2>
	<p>For the purpose of brevity I will assume you know all of Yoshi's moves, but I'll list the most important ones:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Jab: (3, 4) This is one of Yoshi's two "combo-breakers" and also happens to be a great setup move for up-smashes and f-smashes.</li>
		<li>Jab: (3, 4) This is one of Yoshi's two "combo-breakers" and also happens to be a great setup move for up-smashes and f-smashes.</li>
		<li>Up-air: (12) A powerful move that KO's off the top at mid-high percents. Great for juggling and combos.</li>
		<li>Bair: (2, 3, 5) It has three hits, each with massive range. This makes an excellent approach option if you know how to reverse bair.</li>
		<li>Nair: (5-10) This is one of Yoshi's two "combo-breakers" and also happens to be a great setup move for fairs and up-airs. It has a sweetspot during the beginning of the move, and a sourspot later on.</li>
		<li>Dair: (~32 total damage) Quite good for sheild pressure. Has 14 hits, which diminish in damage. Also has sweetspots for all but the last hit right underneath Yoshi.</li>
		<li>Up-tilt: (7) Nice damage and knockback, though it's mainly for use in setting up up-air finishes. It can usually combo into itself once or twice.</li>
		<li>Up-smash: (12-14) Good for finishing off juggles by punishing landings. You can slide into an up-smash quite easily. This is one of Yoshi's most important KO moves, finishing at higher percents. It can hit opponents that are behind Yoshi as he finishes the kick for less damage and knockback.</li>
		<li>Egg Throw: (6) Yoshi's only projectile, and a damn good one. It's fully contrullable and is quite good for gimping horizontal recoveries and covering landings. It also contributes to Yoshi's recovery greatly.</li>
		<li>Yoshi Bomb: (4, 12-15, 4) Considered non-competitive by many, it is actually an important KO move, and is great for interrupting attacks (with the stars that shoot out) and for punishes. It has a sweetspot if done from the ground as Yoshi springs up in the air.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>One thing to note about Yoshi's moves is that his special moves are for utility and his standard attacks are for damage, with some exceptions. Also, you won't need too much AT to play Yoshi. Shorthopping is great to know to perform better combos, fastfalling is reccomended but not necessary, and reverse bairing is a must. As for control scheme, I personally play on a 2DS with default controls and tap jump on. Call me crazy, but it works. Now onto how to play Yoshi.</p>
	<h2>Playstyle:</h2>
	<p>Any 1v1 Smash match will start in neutral. Seeing as yoshi only has one projectile (technically 2 including the stars from his Yoshi Bomb), Yoshi must approach his target, which thankfully isn't too hard. Yoshi has a few bad approaches, and a few decent ones, though not but one or two great ones.
			You should not approach or really ever use the Egg Roll unless by accident. Try not to use the Dash Attack unless you're guaranteed to hit it, though if you do hit one without being shieldgrabbed, it makes a nice setup into fairs. Better options are a reverse bair, a dair, or a nair if you must attack. It's good to know that these are all pretty safe, as if you see that your opponent has shielded your move, you can use Yoshi's awesome air speed to retreat quickly, sometimes in the middle of a bair or dair. Your best option is to cover yourself with an Egg Throw by throwing the egg in front of you, causing the opponent to want to shield, and fast fall into a grab or an Egg Lay to start racking up damage right away. If you manage to Egg your opponent, your shorthopped Dair is a very effective follow-up. Against characters who love to spam projectiles in neutral (Fox, Link, Samus?), Yoshi can double jump across the stage and sometimes use a Fair or Dair to punish. Usually though, Egg Lay and your aerials are your best approach tools. Certain attacks of yours will often string together, but keep in mind Yoshi has no guaranteed combos. For example, if you hit your opponent with a sweetspotted fair while they're on the ground, they'll have to go through a getup animation. This can be used to set up a jab lock, an Egg Lay, or can allow you to land behind them and follow up with an F-smash. Up-tilt -> up-tilt -> up-air is also a nice little non-guaranteed string of note.</p>
	<p>Yoshi's preferred territory is below the opponent or on the edge of the stage, waiting for an easy dunk. When below the opponent, try to juggle them with up-airs or bait an airdodge and Up-smash. This is free damage and both of your main juggling moves KO. Your opponent may catch on to the rhythm of your juggle and properly airdodge, at which point you are free to Fair-spike them into the stage or, if they make for the ledge, the lower blast zone. You'll find Yoshi's favorite characters to rush down and gobble up are the more defensive ones, like Ganondorf.</p>
	<p>Playing defensively with Yoshi isn't usually necessary, but you may find that you're better at punishes than you are at approach. Against certain characters, it can also help greatly. While Yoshi isn't necessarily a defensive character, he has a nice strong shield and a lot of punishing options. The key is to know how to transition from a defensive playstyle to an offensive one. This is where Yoshi shines, as while most characters are either defensive or aggressive, Yoshi can do both!</p>
	<p>You may have to play defensively against more offensive characters, like Fox or ZSS, and more aggressively against the likes of Ike and Link.</p>
	<p>Grabbing isn't one of Yoshi's best options, as his throws don't allow for many follow-up options. Also his grab is easily punishable. In many cases it's just better to use the Egg Lay than a grab, but to clarify, I'll go over some pros and cons.</p>
	<p>Egg Lay:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Can be used in the air</li>
			<li>Allows for more follow-up options</li>
			<li>Can gimp an unprepared opponent</li>
			<li>Can be b-reversed</li>
			<li>Range cannot be adjusted</li>
			<li>Usefulness of follow-ups is questionable, since egged opponents take halved damage</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Grab:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Can be pivoted or dashed for more range</li>
			<li>Yoshi's pummel is god-tier</li>
			<li>Can be used directly out-of-egg</li>
			<li>Can only be used on the ground</li>
			<li>None of Yoshi's throws KO</li>
			<li>Follow-ups are never guaranteedguaranteed</li>
		</ul>
		<p>So basically the choice you make should entirely depend on the situation. There are some things either Yoshi's grab or the Egg Lay can do interchangeably, like mix up an appoach or punishing certain things.</p>
	<p>To summarize, Yoshi is a very fun character to play. To properly use him, you need to know both how to play defensively and offensively very well. It takes a bit of finesse, but after some practice, you'll have sniper-like accuracy with your Egg Throws. You can easily use your nair and jab to escape combos and setup for smashes or juggles at the same time.</p>
