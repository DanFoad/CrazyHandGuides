	<p> There is a Diddy guide, but since Diddy has changed a lot because of the patches, he must be played differently and no current guide are out there at the moment. RIP Hoo-hah :(</p>
	<p>However, he is still viable, observe <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxKALPgLgM">ZeRo winning with Diddy Kong at EVO.</a></p>
