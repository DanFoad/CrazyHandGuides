	<p>
	<p>
		Luigi is a powerhouse if you know how to use him. So, how do we want to begin?
	</p>
	<p><strong>Basics - What you need to know!</strong>
		<br>
		First of all: Luigi is a slow character. His jump? Slow. His dash? Slow. Movement? Sluggish. So you need to know how to handle him.
	</p>
	<ul>	
		<li>Never jump too high, unless you are attacking.</li>
		<li>Never stop running. Shield or Roll out of a run.</li>
		<li>Never land on a platform with his Up-B.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Simple, right?</p>
	
	<p><strong>Recovery - How do?</strong>
	<br>
	His recovery his weird. Yes, he jumps high, but his air-movement is slow. Very, very slow. So how do you recover?
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you are far away from land, use Side-B.</li>
		<li>If you are near enough, use Up-B.</li>
		<li>Always save your jumps.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		 You can also use his Down-B as a recovery-move, but it's really hard and I don't recommend it. But if you want to use it... Press Down-B. After that, mash B as hard as you can.
	</p>
	<p><strong>"Combos" - I know they don't really exsist...</strong>
	<br>
	Luigi has some devestating "combo"s up his sleeves! I will list some now. I will tell you if they are easy, medium or hard difficulty.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>D-Throw -> U-Tilt (0-20%) (Easy)</li>
		<li>D-Throw -> N-Air -> F-Air / U-Air / D-Air (Any) (Easy)</li>
		<li>D-Throw -> U-Special (50%) (Hard)</li>
		<li>D-Throw -> D-Special -> Mash B (Any) (Easy)</li>
		<li>Up-Smash -> Down B -> Down B -> Juggle (50%) (Medium)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These are some examples. You need to know that they don't always work. It depends on the situation.</p>
	<p><strong>Some strategies / useful things / facts.</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Luigi's Side B has a chance to misfire. At around 40-50%, it probably is an instant K.O.! You will also fly a larger distance.</li>
		<li>Luigi's down taunt can spike enemies that are hanging on to a ledge. You need to practise this. It's very hard to hit.</li>
		<li>Up-B can kill at 50 % if you hit just right.</li>
		<li>His down-B is one of the most useful attacks. Enemy trying to approach while you are in the air? Down-B into him. Enemy trying to spike you? Down B and mash B. It can also block some projectiles.</li>
		<li>His B-Air is a really good kill move.</li>
		<li>D-Air can Spike.</li>
		<li>When your enemy is waiting for you near the ledge: Get near the ledge and you enemy, then use his U-Air. The hitbox is pretty big.</li>
		<li>If your enemy is on the ground trying to stand up, dash into him. It will hit him.</li>
		<li>The last frame of his dash-attack has knockback.</li>
		<li>Stuck in enemy's combo / jab? Mash A. Has N-Air can often save you from combos. His Down-Special also kinda save you, if you pull it of just right.</li>
	</ul>
