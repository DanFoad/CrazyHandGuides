	<p>RosaLuma is an interesting character. Many people have been comparing them to an easier version of the Ice Climbers. While I would say it is a fair comparison, I would also say there are a few key distinctions that makes RosaXLuma a bit stronger (this is all conjecture though, no real way to test it, press 1 if you feel bad for IC's). While IC's were all about the grab game, and chaining together moves, RosaXLuma is more about conservation, and when to send out Luma.</p>
	<h2>Moveset w/Luma</h2>
	<p>I won't be going over their moves and how they work, there are plenty of videos on that on the web already. But I would like to draw attention to the key phrase "w/Luma". As tempting as it might be to send out Luma to go do your bidding for you, I urge you not to.</p>
	<p>The trend people have been setting is to immediately send out Luma, so you "control" more space. The thing is... luma is pretty bad on his own. Really. I'm serious. A dash attack can send him to his doom, leaving you practically naked without him. With Luma next to you, for a majority of the match, you can really benefit.</p>
	<p>w/Luma, you have...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>His moves combined with yours. Keep in mind, Luma has his own moveset, plus a side B only accessible by him and a recovery/down B only accessible by you. Luma also adds more range and damage to your attacks. While Rosalina's Fair on her own may do around 11%, with Luma it's bumped up to 15%, with his additional hit. Not to mention, Luma's moves are better for getting the KO's, while Rosalina's is better for racking up damage.</li>
		<li>A moving shield. He can take up to 52% damage, useful for the occasional Energy Shot or Sun Salutation (if they caught you off guard, don't forget about Rosie's down B!).</li>
		<li>A way to escape grab and helpless punishes. People who try to pummel Rosa can be hit my Luma, to knock them off. This also works for broken shields, sleeping, being grounded and when falling helplessly after Rosa's recovery.</li>
		<li>Someone to protect Luma. This cute lil asshat buddy of ours gets knocked around a bunch, and he doesn't recover from hitstun until he hits the ground. With Luma called to your side, he'll never be too far away, can be protected in your shields (if they are large enough), and will come right back to you as soon as he recovers from his last punt.</li>
		<li>The Luma Shot panic button. If someone gets too close, or you need a quick punish, tapping b sends Luma out almost immediately, with a decent range and knockback as well. Gives ya plenty of time to compose yourself and call Luma back.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>While it might be nice to have multiple smashes in different places, once people figure out how easy it is to get rid of luma, sending him out all willy nilly will just be painting a target on his back and yours.</p>
	<p>Keep in mind that teamwork does not necessarily mean keeping him away all the time! They work well together, and knowing when to separate is a huge advantage, not the key to playing them.</p>
	<p>A few situations when to "split up gang!" (shout outs to Scooby Doo. Fun fact: I had my whole room themed with SCooby Doo when I was a kid. Had stickers everywhere and they GLOWED IN THE DARK LIKE A BOSS! Anyone remember those glow in the dark stars you could put in your room? Whatever happened to those...? I should see if Amazon has some.)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Using a Charged Luma Shot as a punish or KO option.</li>
		<li>Fishing for the smash attack to close out a stock.</li>
		<li>Stop camping. Use star bits to your advantage to flush people off the edge!</li>
		<li>Using as bait. People try to punish Luma, go for a dash attack or grab! (btw, Grab > Down Throw > Fair is pretty good with Rosa).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>So those are my two cents on the topic of RosaLuma.</p>
