	<p>Welcome to the Koopa Troop, trainee! so you wanna learn how to play the biggest, baddest king in SM4SH, huh? I've written this guide to help other aspiring Bowser mains get even the slightest bit better. This guide goes in depth will all of Bowsers moves, and gives you some examples of when you could best use them. All kill percentages listed are rough estimates.</p>
	<h4>--Bowser's Characteristics--</h4>
	<p>Bowser has a unique ability, known as "Tough Guy". because of this ability, any low-power attacks Bowser receives will give him 0 knockback. some examples are MegaMan's lemons, or a Jab combo. The final hit of jab combos will still punch Bowser back, but the multi-hit portion found in the likes of Little Mac or Kirby will simply leave them open for a punish. keep in mind, however, this ability does not take affect if Bowser is in the air, and when he's standing it will only take affect from a jab combo. While preforming an attack *besides aerials, you are under the tough guy law, but when running or charging an attack, the law does not take affect.</p>
	<p>Bowser is a heavy weight, meaning he can take lots of hits, but is also extremely susceptible to being juggled. ironically, you'll find yourself having a lot of trouble with good Mario players. Like most heavy characters, Bowser can definitely thrive off of a bait-and-punish tactic. However, Bowser has many tools to allow himself entry into a lot of fighters defenses.</p>
	<h4> TILTS, JAB, DASH ATTACK </h4>
	<p><strong>Forward Tilts:</strong> Bowser's Ftilt is a strong, quick attack. you can angle it up, straight, or down depending on how you angle the left stick, meaning it has a lot of options. It has a bit of a disjointed hitbox at the tip, so it can hit through some attacks without Bowser taking any damage. This is usually your best option for hitting someone in front of you, or even reading rolls since it reaches so far and comes out quick.</p>
	<p><strong>Up Tilt:</strong> As of patch 1.0.9, the hitbox has been fixed so that it will hit opponents infront of bowser, including someone as short as olimar, and shoot them just high enough for combos. You can string it up to four times at 0%.  The best part about this move is that it sends the opponent directly above you, which is exactly where you want your enemies. With a powerful and quick Bair and Uair, you can punish airdodges or link them after a Utilt to deal a lot of damage, or even seal the deal. Usmash and Utilt are also amazing Anti-air moves, all the more reason to want your opponent in the sky. As of the update, while i don't recommend using it all the time, i would say Utilt has improved Bowser's viability tremendously.</p>
	<p><strong>Down Tilt:</strong> A double-hitting attack so the opponent cannot perfect shield the whole attack, and eats through shields quickly. Usually you will only hit your opponent with the first swipe, which will knock them too far away to be hit with the second. If you're close enough, however, you can lock them into both hits until they get to a high enough percentage. it has a chance to trip your opponent, and can hit opponents grabbing the ledge who have no invincibility. At the ledge, it can kill at around 90% easily. It's long reach also makes it great for punishing rolls, or hitting opponents who are trying to recover..</p>
	<p><strong>Neutral A JAB: </strong>  Bowser's neutral A is two-hit set of punches, the first punch doing 5% while the second does 6%. The attack usually links into itself, but is harder at higher percentages. he does not have a jab combo like Captain Falcon or Kirby</p>
	<p><strong>Dash Attack: </strong> Bowser's dash attack is... decent, at best. It's not something you want to be using too much since there's a decent amount of ending lag, and it can't kill. If you sweetspot the opponent directly with the dash attack, it'll do around 10%. if you hit them with just your toes at the last few frames of the attack, you'll do closer to 8%.</p>
	<h4>--Specials--</h4>
	<p><strong>Neutral Special: </strong>Bowser's Neutral Special is fire breath. damaging close-range opponents and locking them into an inferno from your mouth, best used for ledge guarding. opponents like Ness who have a tricky recovery suffer the most from this, since firebreath stops them for snapping onto the ledge. this can be extremely annoying for your opponent, plus the bonus of racking up anywhere from 4% to 20%.Try not to use your neutral special off stage, as there is end lag that can stop you from recovering properly. the tip of the flames will inflict 0 knockback but still do damage, keep this in mind.</p>
	<p><strong>Side Special: </strong> Bowser's Side special is Flying slam. This is a COMMAND GRAB, and has more uses then just suiciding. A command grab means that it is a move that functions similar to a grab, but can be used both grounded and in the air. Also, have you ever used his Side special, input a direction, only to go a completely different direction? Flying slam's trajectory can be altered left or right, and the direction is determined by whichever party has less %. if your opponent has less percent than you and you use flying slam, they get to decide which direction you go and where you land - however, if they don't input anything, your input takes control.</p>
	<p><strong>Up Special:</strong>Bowser's Uspecial is Whirling Fortress. On the ground, you can move yourself while preforming the attack to give yourself maximum range. It is a multi hit attack so perfect shielding will not work, and does a number on shields in the process. Whirling Fortress is also Bowser's best option for an out of shield attack, and CAN kill, just not very reliably. Recovery wise, this move honestly isn't too bad, though it is extremely difficult to use properly without knowledge of how it works. It has much more Horizontal distance than it does vertical, but that's not to say you can't recover if you're below the stage. Like many other moves, spamming your specials button makes you travel higher and farther, but this is a double edge sword; I cannot begin to describe the number of times I've spammed my special to try and make it back, and then accidentally preform a get-up attack and get punished.</p>
	<p><strong>Down Special:</strong>Bowser's Dspecial is the Bowser Butt Bomb. When used in the air, you get launched directly downwards. There's enough startup lag that opponents will usually have enough time to evade this, so it's not something you want to use regularly - and please, I can NOT stress this enough, you do NOT need to slam down to get back on to the stage whenever you're in the air. it's an extremely punishable move and should rarely be used. What most people don't realize is that Bowser has a different animation if you use this move on the ground- In fact, THE GROUNDED VERSION OF THIS IS EXTREMELY USEFUL. Used at close range, Bowser launches the opponent upwards with his horns, jumps above them, and then flies down at them. if you hit the opponent with your horns, they cannot DI or airdodge their way out of the second downwards hit. It has all the power of an aerial Butt bomb, but with an added percentage of hitting them with your horns. If an opponent shields the first horn attack however, they will have time to roll away from the downwards attack, so again, don't get too comfortable with it. An important part of this trick, however, is that the downward slam of this attack can break shields. </p>
	<h4>--Smashes--</h4>
	<p><strong>Forward Smash:</strong>Bowser's Fsmash is his signature drop kick. It has a surprising amount of range to it, along with an extremely high launch power. An uncharged Fsmash can kill around 60%, while fully charged can kill closer to 40%. However, balancing this move out is its extreme risk with high endlag, and a few frames before the move actually starts once you let go of the buttons/c-stick. To be used sparingly, but by far his strongest attack.</p>
	<p><strong>Up Smash:</strong>Bowser's Usmash is extremely unorthodox. Bowser gets down on all fours, pushes his shell upwards just higher than his normal standing height, and then slams back on the ground. He has hitboxes at the top of his shell, and another hitbox on the ground when he slams back down, pushing opponents lucking for a punish backwards. As well, Bowser has invincibility frames on his shell when preforming a Usmash; and i don't mean priority, i mean actual invincibility. If you throw out a Usmash on a falling opponent and they counter, they hit the shell, and Bowser takes zero damage and knockback.</p>
	<p><strong>Down Smash:</strong>Bowser's Dsmash is similar to whirling fortress, but with a trade off. Unlike whirling fortress, you cannot move after preforming Dsmash, however it has more killing potential than whirling fortress. It will not kill nearly as early as Fsmash or Usmash, and it has next to no range since it's half the size of standing bowser, but it still has the possibly for kills if you can read a roll. The only real use for this is reading a normal get-up from the ledge. since there are so many active frames, there's a good chance you'll hit them before they can put up their shield. Still, i rarely use Dsmash, i think it's one of his worst moves. In my personal opinion, Whirling fortress > Dsmash</p>
	<h4>--Aerials--</h4>
	<p><strong>Neutral Air: </strong> Bowsers nair extends his body, hitting with his tail, arms, and legs. it can do 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% if you can string all four hits into it. The best positioning so that you hit your opponent all four times is for them to be in the bottom corner of whatever direction Bowser is facing. (i.e if bowser is facing left, the bottom left corner of the hitbox. if he's facing right, the bottom right corner of the hitbox.) The move is also good for getting out of juggles, but be careful using it too close to the ground otherwise you'll get trapped in HEAPS of landing lag.</p>
	<p><strong>Forward Air: </strong> Probably one of Bowser's best moves, and it's borderline broken. the range extends about 1 1/2 Bowser's, and reaches 180° in front of him. (directly above him, all the way directly below him.) the move can kill around 70%-80% at the edge, even sooner for light characters, and there's no real sour spot to the move. This move can be used in scenarios more than just when the opponent is in front of you in the air - if you hit them with the end of the swipe under Bowser, you'll actually launch them behind you which can lead to a stage spike if you preform it correctly, or you can confuse someone by jumping above them and then Fairing them behind you. the range is enough that you can short hop Fair with ease, and even if they shield the attack you can move back enough that they can't grab punish. To make it even better, a single slice does 12%-13%. So, massive damage, range, crazy hitboxes, great killing power, and comes out quick. Easily Bowser's main bread and butter in a single move.</p>
	<p><strong>Up Air: </strong>I personally never find myself using Uair too much, it's extremely telegraphed and has very little range to it. It is still a very strong move, dealing 15% and kills mid-map at around 110%. Sometimes you can follow up a Uthrow with this, but only if the opponent DI's incorrectly or if they're also a heavy weight. very situational, not a go-to move to use.</p>
	<p><strong>Back Air: </strong> Bowser's strongest aerial. the hitbox extends straight out backwards in a rectangular shape. this can kill super early, great for edgeguarding if you trust yourself enough to land it, but i personally prefer the range with Fair depending on the situation. if you're grabbing the ledge and they're off stage as well, jump up and surprise them. Be cautious with Bairs when landing, you can't short hop them without a heap of lag, but Full-hopping is fine.</p>
	<p><strong>Down Air: </strong>Bowser shoots straight down, stuck in the animation until you either launch into the void or hit the ground. once you hit the ground, you're trapped in a bit of landing lag. To cover that, along side the obvious hitbox of his shell, there are mini hitboxes on the sides of Bowser, much like Dedede's stars when he lands from his recovery, only MUCH smaller, and there is no apparent animation. they only do 2%, but they're just enough to stun your opponent before they can punish you.</p>
	<h4>--Grabs--</h4>
	<p>I won't really go into too much detail with these. Bowser has REALLY good grab range, but none of his grabs really link into anything. All throws do 12%, except for his Up throw that does 10%. to make up for the 2%, you can double jump then Fair your opponent after a Uthrow, totaling 23%. However, this only works at lower percentages, and light characters wont be affected by this at all unless they DI incorrectly. Heavy characters are susceptible to this however, and sometimes this can work to decently high percentages, but don't rely on it too much. Still, bait out reactions, whether it be an airdodge, or getting rid of their second jump. Forward throw and Back throw are your kill throws. Both kill very reliably at the edge, and with rage you can kill a lot of the cast as early as 80%. Dthrow is usefull as well, but in a different way. Dthrow can't link anything, and it can't kill- but you want to use Dthrow to both A- intimidate your opponents with its sick-ass animation, and B- get that 12% damage in without stailing your throw kills. The more you use a move, the less damage and knockback it does until you die; so just throwing forward and backward the whole time, you wont be able to kill with them as easily. You can't get any follow up out of them either, so it's always best to go for that Dthrow when you just need the percent.</p>
	<h4>--Strategies--</h4>
	<p>Bowser is all melee attacks. He lacks any ranged attacks besides fire breath but that doesn't reach very far. He definitely struggle with ranged characters, specifically Duck Hunt. I've won against only one single Duck Hunt, and that was fighting someone playing Random. All you can do is power shield, spot dodge, and punish. Fire breath can actually take care of some projectiles, like Duck hunt's Frisbee or Villager's lloyd, but this also leaves you wide open to an attack from above or behind you. fire breath won't destroy stronger projectiles, like Samus's charge shot or MegaMan's Fsmash. You will definitely struggle with projectile based characters, but dodging, shielding, and punishing correctly will surely lead you to victory.
	Bowser is a super aggressive character, but he need to be played defensively. Don't be running right into the opponent and dash-attacking, throwing out grabs, or Fair-ing over and over. Shield and grab, jab them, Uspecial, Usmash, whatever you can do to punish them - but remember, don't get too crazy! any percent punish is good, even if it's not the most, and with bowser you're usually gonna get at LEAST 10%. Still, just because you're a defensive heavy doesn't mean you can't be aggressive too - chasing off stage with Fairs, edgeguarding with an on-stage Dair for a spike, fire-breathing off the edge of the stage, or stage-spike them with a Bair as they're recovering. you have a LOT of options throughout the match, use them!
	The best place to keep your opponents is in the air above you. As i mentioned with Utilt, bowser has lots of tools to keep people from landing. With an invisable Usmash, a wide-arcing Utilt, and an extremely powerful Uair and Bair, he's got all the tools he needs to keep opponents off the ground if he can read them correctly. While he has amazing tools for ground battle as well, just keep in mind that juggling an opponent in the air and scaring them into airdodging is one of your best tactics ; Bait and punish!
	As bowser, you're gonna have a hard time against projectile spammers. To handle these types of fighters, force them towards the ledge. Once they're at the ledge, projectile spammers will either roll into you, or continue rolling into the ledge even though there's nowhere to go. all you have to do is use Whirling fortress. Since you can move while using the attack, you can react accordingly to whether they stay where they are, or if they roll directly into you. rinse and repeat until dead.</p>
	<h4>Closing</h4>
	<p>THANK YOU for taking the time to read through this long guide. Its taken me about a week to compile all of this and figure out the best way to say what I want to say, but I hope all of this is concise and clear enough for you all to understand! This was incredibly fun to write, and I hope I've helped at least a few people get even the tiniest bit better at playing Bowser. I have a history of stuttering with words, repeating myself, and just have speach difficulties in general, and it has definitely carried into my typing abilities as well, yet I still had an urge to write this. Let's hope it was worth it!</p>
